Nano is a C++ template metaprogramming library. It was originally created so that I could learn template
metaprogramming, but as I explored TMP further I realized that there are numerous places where it can be used
to improve performance.

Initially, I found that there were not may resources on TMP and that the syntax was challenging at first. I
have documented the Nano code heavily, and have provided some examples of TMP on my
[blog](https://robclu.github.io) so that anyone starting with TMP will (hopefully) find Nano, and its source
code, useful.
